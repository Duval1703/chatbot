# MediChat AI - Critical Fixes Applied ✅

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Chat History Language Preservation** ✅
**Problem**: Chat history was saving messages in English regardless of original language
**Solution**: 
- Updated `useChat.ts` to preserve original language in database storage
- Chat messages now saved in the language they were typed in
- Translation still works for AI processing but preserves user's original language

### 2. **Text-to-Speech Stop Functionality** ✅
**Problem**: Speaker button wouldn't stop reading when clicked
**Solution**: 
- Fixed `useTextToSpeech.ts` stop function
- Updated ChatInterface button to properly toggle between play/stop
- Improved error handling to suppress "interrupted" error messages
- Better voice selection for French pronunciation

### 3. **Chat Session Names** ✅
**Problem**: Sessions named "Chat 1, Chat 2" instead of meaningful titles
**Solution**: 
- Updated backend `chat.py` to use first question as session name
- Truncates long questions to 50 characters + "..."
- Much more descriptive session titles in chat history

### 4. **Authentication 401 Errors** ✅
**Problem**: Getting 401 Unauthorized errors on `/api/auth/me`
**Solution**: 
- Added better error handling in `AuthContext.tsx`
- Improved API service with proper 401 handling
- Silent token cleanup when expired
- Better user experience with expired tokens

### 5. **Landing Page Navigation** ✅
**Problem**: Missing navigation tabs as requested
**Solution**: 
- Added sticky navigation header with smooth scrolling
- Home, About, Features, Testimonials, Contact tabs
- Active tab highlighting based on scroll position
- Professional navigation experience

## 🎯 Test Results

### **Chat History Testing**:
1. Change language to French
2. Send message: "Bonjour, j'ai mal à la tête"
3. Check chat history - should show French text, not English translation

### **Text-to-Speech Testing**:
1. Ask any medical question
2. Click speaker icon (🔊) to start reading
3. Click again (shows 🔊❌) to stop reading

### **Session Names Testing**:
1. Start new chat with question: "What are fever symptoms?"
2. Check chat history sidebar

2. No more 401 error toasts in console
3. Silent token refresh when expired

### **Landing Page Navigation**:
